## Overview of the Analysis

For this analysis, we were given a set of data from NYC Citi Bikes from August of 2019. We were instructed to use Tableau to create visualizations that will provide investors in Des Moines with a good snapshot into what the bike-shareing program is like. We hope to use these data vizualizations to solidify the proposal.

## Results

The first visualization I created is a line graph of the checkout time by users. This shows us the amount of bikes that were used for 0, 1, 2 hours. The trips seem to peak around 10-50 minutes and there is a sharp decline, almost to zero, after one hour of trip duration.

The second visualitzation represents the checkout time by gender - also a line graph. This shows us the same as the above, but split up by gender of the users. There is a significantly more amount of male users thatn femal or unknown. It appears that males also seem to have longer trip durations.

The next visualization is a heat map of bike trips by hour and by weekday. This shows us the most popular hours of the each day of the week the bikes are being used. We can easily tell the most popular times/days are around commuting times  i.e. 8-9am M-F, and 5-7pm M-F. And also Saturday from 11am-6pm are relatively popular, I would assume that contributes to tourism.

The fourth visualization is a heat map by day/hour/gender. Looking at the below, we can see similar results with a heavier concentration in male trips which is to be expected because of the higher amount of male users overall.

The fifth visualization shows us user trips by gender by weekday. Usertype refers to customer vs subscriber. Looking at this heat map, there is a very significant amount of male subscribers.

The sixth visualization shows us the top starting location of the trips. By looking at the larger circles, we are able to see which spots have a higher amount of trips being started. It looks like mid-Manhattan is a very popular spot.

The last visualization shows us the top ending locations. This map looks very similar to the starting locations, which could be due to the short trip duration we are seeing in the first visualization. Since users are not typically using the bikes over an hour, it limits the distance they can go, so I would expect their start locations to be close to their end locations.

![Top Ending Location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90940985/161655061-7039b7f0-471e-474d-98d6-791df4e46140.jpg)

By looking at these results, there is a higher overall usage of the bikes by male than there are female or unknown. It seems like a majority of these rides are commuting rides. I would like to see visualizations that show the starting and ending locations by hour and day of the week to see the flow of traffic between boroughs and rush hour traffic and see trends there. I would also look at weather data to see what impact temperature, precipitation and other weather factors have on the usage of the citi bikes.
